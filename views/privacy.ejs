      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Effective date: January 3, 2026</p>

      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Globlit ("we", "us", or "our"), operated by Dantel, collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use our website and services. Globlit is a news reader that provides personalized "For You" feeds, topic-based discovery, search, article reading (including text-to-speech), and the ability to save and share stories. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information described below.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>1.1 Account & Profile Data</h3>
      <p>If you create an account or sign in, we collect information you provide such as username and profile image. We store account information to enable personalized features (saved stories, followed topics, preferences) and to authenticate you across sessions.</p>

      <h3>1.2 Content & Activity Data</h3>
      <p>We collect data about how you use the Service, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Feeds and interactions: topics you follow, articles you open, save, or share.</li>
        <li>Search queries and topic navigation to improve recommendations.</li>
        <li>Anonymous telemetry for analytics, performance, and debugging.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.3 Location and Device Data</h3>
      <p>To provide localized "For You" feeds we may use your device's approximate location (country/region) obtained via the browser Geolocation API. Geolocation is requested only with your permission and is used transiently by the browser and our client code to determine an appropriate local news region; we do not persist precise GPS coordinates on our servers unless you explicitly provide them as part of your profile. We also collect device and technical data such as IP address (anonymized for analytics where feasible), browser, operating system, and screen resolution.</p>

      <h3>1.4 Cookies, Local Storage and Client-side Data</h3>
      <p>We use cookies and similar local storage mechanisms to provide sessions, remember theme and preferences, and support in-browser features such as the text-to-speech reader. The site also stores small amounts of data (e.g., theme choice) in <code>localStorage</code> for a better experience. You can manage cookies and local storage through your browser settings.</p>

      <h3>1.5 Third-Party Content</h3>
      <p>Articles displayed in Globlit are retrieved from third-party news providers via our server-side proxy. We do not embed or expose third-party API keys in client code. When you request an article, our server fetches the content from the source and returns it to the client; the source's own copyright and terms apply to that content.</p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We use information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and operate the Service, including account management and feeds.</li>
        <li>Personalize content and recommendations ("For You" feeds, topics you follow).</li>
        <li>Enable features such as saved stories, sharing, and text-to-speech playback.</li>
        <li>Detect and prevent abuse, fraud, and security threats.</li>
        <li>Perform analytics and measure feature usage to improve the product.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Third Parties and Sharing</h2>
      <p>We may share information with third parties only as necessary to operate the Service, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hosting and infrastructure providers that store data on our behalf.</li>
        <li>Analytics providers that process anonymized usage data.</li>
        <li>Third-party APIs and content providers when fetching news articles (via our server-side proxy).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may disclose information if required by law or to protect legal rights.</p>

      <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>Account data (profile, saved stories, followed topics) is retained until you delete your account or request deletion. Usage logs and anonymized analytics are typically retained for up to 12 months to support debugging and product improvements, unless a different retention period is required by law.</p>

      <h2>5. Security</h2>
      <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect data. Access to personal data is limited to authorized personnel. In case of a security incident we will notify affected users and authorities where required.</p>

      <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
      <p>You can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Manage cookies and local storage through your browser settings.</li>
        <li>Update or delete account information from account settings when signed in.</li>
        <li>Contact us to request access or deletion of personal data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. International Transfers</h2>
      <p>We operate globally; data may be processed in countries other than your residence. When required by law we use appropriate safeguards for international data transfers.</p>

      <h2>8. Children</h2>
      <p>Our Service is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such data, please contact us and we will promptly delete it.</p>

      <h2>9. Changes to this Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted with a new Effective Date. Your continued use after changes indicates acceptance.</p>

      <h2>10. Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have questions or requests, contact our privacy team at <a href="mailto:dantelcode@gmail.com" class="email">dantelcode@gmail.com</a>.</p>
